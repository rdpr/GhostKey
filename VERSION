# This file is DEPRECATED and no longer used for versioning.
#
# GhostKey now uses AUTOMATIC SEMANTIC VERSIONING based on conventional commits.
# Versions are automatically calculated from git tags and commit types:
#
# - fix:  → Patch bump (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
# - feat: → Minor bump (1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
# - !:    → Major bump (1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
#
# You don't need to update this file. The CI/CD workflows automatically:
# 1. Find the latest stable version from git tags
# 2. Analyze commits since last release
# 3. Determine bump level (major/minor/patch)
# 4. Calculate and apply the new version
# 5. Add channel suffixes for dev/beta releases
#
# For more information, see CONTRIBUTING.md

# Reference only (not used by workflows):
# Last manually tracked version: 1.1.0
